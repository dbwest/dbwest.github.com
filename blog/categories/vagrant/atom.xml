    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a self contained Vagrant box for testing. Currently it loads, Appium, Jenkins, and rvm and some other things. It provisions from a base image and forwards the ports for Jenkins.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Next</h2>

<p>I still need to</p>

<ul>
<li>Find a way to have the box drive tests on simulators on the host machine. I&rsquo;m going to see if the guest box can do this, even if the host box isn&rsquo;t the machine with Appium. I want the Vagrant box to have as much on it as I can put on it, and I want to see if it can be where Appium resides.</li>
<li>Modify the tests to use Appium remotely on the Vagrant box. I&rsquo;ll want to fork a test repo I&rsquo;ve been working on, modify it to work with the new setup</li>
<li>Make jobs to kick off the tests.</li>
<li>And maybe more! I&rsquo;ll find out&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>The prospect of doing this is very exciting to me. Setting all this up takes a lot of steps, so when done by hand, it may work on one machine and not on another. This should get closer to solving that.</p>
